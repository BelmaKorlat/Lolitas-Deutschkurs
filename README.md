# Lolitas-Deutschkurs

This project is a website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for promoting a German language course. The website provides comprehensive information about the course, including two available plans: individual and group. The pricing of the course varies based on specific categories, such as reading and listening, grammar, and preparation for the Studienkolleg. All of these categories are conveniently listed on the website for easy access and understanding.

Upon selecting a specific course plan, users are directed to a section at the bottom of the page where they can fill in their credentials. This information is then sent to the course owner's email address, allowing for direct communication and enrollment.
